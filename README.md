## Studying to become a Web Developer
### Currently learning Javascript and building small projects and websites
My main goal is to get a job in the Web Developlment field. Since I recently started studying, I decided to begin with Front End development learning HTML, CSS and Javascript.
I have a degree in Computer Engeneering and used to work as a Support Technician at a public Hospital. After the outbreak of Covid-19, I decided to resign and change fields from Support to Development.
